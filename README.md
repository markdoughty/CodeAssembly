  <b>What is CodeAssembly?</b><br>
A programming club for students in the School of Computer Science. Anyone can work on anything with anyone.<p>
  <b>Why?</b><br>
To give students a chance to work on program code be it on their own or with others. There is no set project or theme, just a chance for students to increase their programming experience and knowledge.
