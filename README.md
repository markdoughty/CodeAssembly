Welcome to the CodeAssembly GitHub site!<p>
  <b>What is CodeAssembly?</b><br>
A programming club for students in the School of Computer Science. Anyone can work on anything with anyone.<p>
  <b>Why?</b><br>
To give students a chance to work on program code be it on their own or with others. There is no set project or theme, just a chance for students to increase their programming experience and knowledge.<p>
  <b>How?</b><br>
Methods such as 'Mob Programming' (check it out here <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming">What is Mob Programming?</a>) and websites such as <a href="https://www.codingame.com/home">Codingame.com</a> will encourage contribution.
